## ðŸ‘‹ Hello
Iâ€™m Cameron Montgomery. I am a Software Engineer living in Centennial, CO. I graduated from Hack Reactor Advanced Software Immersive in December 2022 and spent the following 5 months in an apprenticeship at Square (Block), where I worked with the payment onboarding team, taking part in international SEV remediations and working toward bringing Square's great service to more business types here in the US. I am both open to employment opportunities and looking for collaborators with possible paid work.

### :speech_balloon: About 

>If you would like to know a little about me, I'm a Colorado native and still call it home, even though I have lived in various states and spent almost a year in Japan. I am a father and husband who loves experiencing life with his family. I love the mountains, fly fishing, camping, snowboarding, video games, and building projects with the kids. I am also passionate about investing in people and helping them grow into the best versions of themselves. In hopes of helping to facilitate this in some small way, I have served in various mentorship positions, helping others through different areas of their life, from mental health and substance abuse issues to career skills and software engineering. Currently, I serve as a technical mentor with Next Chapter helping judicially impacted individuals make it through their studies and find employment in technology.
>
>I have done a few different things before pursuing software. I spent 5 years on active duty in the US. Marine Corps, worked offshore and held a maritime license and crane operator license. I owned and operated Tattered Flag Services, a garage door installation & service business and served as a director and ambassador for WarriorNow, a non-profit serving veterans suffering from PTSD, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and other mental health challenges.
>
>Currently, I am working on building an e-commerce ecosystem for two new businesses I am launching.
