- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cameron Montgomery working under @Tribalash on GitHub. I am currently attending Red Rocks Community College
in Lakewood, CO working toward a degree in Secure Software Development. I am also a student with JR Launch, a development
boot camp teaching full-stack web development. I live in Centennial, CO, and am a Colorado native, even though I have lived in various states and spent almost a year in Japan. I have done a few different things before pursuing development. I spent 5 years on active duty in the US. Marine Corps, worked offshore in the oil industry, as a technician with DirecTV, and worked as a director with WarriorNow.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in growing my development skills and working toward a career in the industry. I love the challenge and sense of accomplishment that developing something gives you. Coding is something that is more than just a skill that gets you a career for me its a true joy and I look forward to where development takes me.
