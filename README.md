- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cameron Montgomery working under @Tribalash on GitHub. I am currently attending Red Rocks Community College
in Lakewood, CO working toward a degree in Secure Software Development. I am preparing for the Septermber cohort at Hack Reactor. I live in Centennial, CO, and am a Colorado native, even though I have lived in various states and spent almost a year in Japan. I have done a few different things before pursuing development. I spent 5 years on active duty in the US. Marine Corps, worked offshore, as a technician with DirecTV, and worked as a director with WarriorNow a non-profit serving veterans suffering with PTSD, other mental health challenges, substance abuse, and judicial involvment.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in growing my development skills and working toward a career in the industry. I love the challenge and sense of accomplishment that developing something gives you. Coding is something that is more than just a skill that gets you a career for me, its a true joy. I look forward to where the skills that I am developing today takes me tomorrow.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, EJS, and Handlebars. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Python
